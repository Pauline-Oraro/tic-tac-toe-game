# Getting Started with TicTacToe Game created in react

The code defines a functional component called Square. It takes two props: value and onSquareClick. The Square component renders a button element with the square class. When the button is clicked, the onSquareClick function is called. The value prop is displayed as the button's text.


The code defines another functional component called Board. It takes three props: xIsNext, squares, and onPlay. The Board component represents the game board and handles the logic for updating the game state when a square is clicked.


Inside the Board component, there is a handleClick function that is called when a square is clicked. It checks if there is a winner or if the square is already filled. If either condition is true, the function returns early and doesn't update the game state. Otherwise, it creates a new array nextSquares by making a copy of the squares array. It then updates the value of the clicked square based on whether it's "X" or "O". Finally, it calls the onPlay function, passing the nextSquares array.


The calculateWinner function is a helper function that checks if there is a winner based on the current state of the squares array. It checks all possible winning combinations and returns the winning symbol ("X" or "O") if there is a winner, or null if there is no winner.


The Board component also declares a winner variable by calling the calculateWinner function with the squares prop. It determines the current winner of the game.


The status variable is set based on the winner variable. If there is a winner, it displays "Winner: " followed by the winning symbol. Otherwise, it displays "Next player: " followed by either "X" or "O" based on the value of xIsNext.


The Board component returns JSX elements representing the game board. It includes the game title, the current status, and a grid of Square components representing the squares of the game board. Each Square component receives the corresponding value from the squares array and the handleClick function as props.


The Game component is the top-level component that manages the game state. It uses the useState hook to define two state variables: history and currentMove. The history state stores an array of all the game states, and currentMove keeps track of the current move.


The handlePlay function is passed as a prop to the Board component. It is called when a square is clicked and updates the game history and current move. It creates a new nextHistory array by cloning the history array, appending the new nextSquares array to it. Then, it updates the history state and sets the currentMove state to the index of the new move.


The jumpTo function is used to update the currentMove state when a move button is clicked. It sets the currentMove state to the nextMove parameter, effectively changing the current move and updating the game board.


The moves variable is created by mapping over the history array. It generates a list of move buttons that allow the player to jump to a specific move. The button's onClick event is set to call the jumpTo function with the corresponding move index.


The Game component returns JSX elements representing the game. It includes the Board component, passing the xIsNext state, the current squares from the history, and the handlePlay function as props. It also renders the move list using the moves variable.
